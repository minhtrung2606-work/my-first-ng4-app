<div class="product-form">
  <h1>Product Form</h1>

  <!--

    - Whenever NgForm is included/marked to be accessible within your module then the component will be automatically
      attached to any <form> tag in your template and silently supplies:
      + An instance of type FormGroup named ngForm
      + A (ngSubmit) output

    - #v=thing syntax: says we wanna create a local variable named `v` used in this template and is assigned to `thing`

    - It seems like we have a typo here when we're saying #f="ngForm". But there was no typo.
      If ngForm is the key then that means we wanna use NgForm on this attribute and assigning a reference to the type
      FormGroup which is held by local variable `f` of this template (meaning local variable `l` had been assigned to
      hold an reference to an instance of type FormGroup before being assigned to NgForm component as an input)
      Here, we're trying to EXPORT an instance of type FormGroup which is automatically instantiated by NgForm component via
      ngForm local variable to an alias variable named `f`

    - Notice that we didn't attach any NgForm component here in the form tag but we could still use (ngSubmit) output in the
      <form> tag because (like it stated before) once FormsModule is imported into your module then NgForm component is auto-
      matically attached to any <form> tag to supply an instance of type FormGroup via ngForm and an output ngSubmit for use

    - When we use ngModel with no attribute value within automatically attached ngForm component like this, we state:
      + A one-way data binding
      + We wanna create a FormControl on this input with the name of sku (the value of the name attribute in the input
        tag)

    - ngModel in this case creates a new FormControl that is automatically added to the parent FormGroup (here's ngForm)
      and then bind a DOM element to this FormControl instance which means it builds up a association between the input
      tag in our view/template and the FormControl which is matched by a name of "sku"
